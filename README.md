# UFOs Analysis

### UFOs Challenge Overview
In this challenge we are using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a webpage to showcase different UFO sightings around the globe. The webpage will contain a dynamic table for filtering the UFO sightings data in the data.js file. We will aslo be making the website look nice and clean with some Bootstrap magic. 


## UFOs Analysis Results
Our webpage has a wonderful fully functional filter that allows users to input different search criteria into different fields with in the filter. The filter allows users to enter the following fields ( Date, City, State, Country, Shape of the UFO), the filter takes the users inputs and returns the data the matches the search criteria the use entered into the filter. After filling out all of the necessarey fields the user can hit enter to update the table and return the results of their search. The filter can be cleared by clicking the nav bar at the top of the page. Take a look below for a quick tutorial on how to properly use the search fitler.

## Analysis Summary

So we made a pretty nifty website to search UFO sighting information, it's cool, it works, and it's visually appealing. Great but there is so much more we could do with this site. 

    ### Drawbacks
      *JavaScript is case sensitive, any incorrect user input could returna bad result from the filter. 
      *Would be nice if the filter had drop down menus for inputs.
      *Data set could be larger or linked to an actual databaseof UFO sightings.
    
    ### Recomendations 
      *Improve the site to be more user friendly, since JavaScript is case sensitive and users could accidently generate empty search results. This problem could be circumvented by adding drop down menus for the filter input.
      *In order to help people better visualise the info this page is hosting, we could incorporate a map of the UFO sightings that refences the data in the data.js file to show the location of the sightings on a map. You could also potentially apply filters to the map visual to allow users to select filter options and then have those update the map.
      *Find or create a larger data set of UFO's sightings, preferably link the website to a data base that is constantly updated with new sighting data.
